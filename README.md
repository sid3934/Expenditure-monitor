# Expenditure-monitor
I have built a web app in the MERN stack to display the personal expenses.  The project also includes a Google pay payment gateway. <br>
The front end is built in React js and Tailwind CSS is used for styling. 
The command to install tailwind CSS is <br>
`npm install -D tailwindcss` <br>
`npx tailwindcss init` <br>
Charts are rendered using Chartjs the installation for charts is <br>
`npm install chart.js` <br>
React hook for forms is used from `npm i react-hook-form` <br>
The doughnut shape for chart is installed from `npm i react-chartjs-2` <br>
React redux is install as `npm i @reduxjs/toolkit` <br>
The gateway for google payment is implemented using google developer support as shown in the [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-pay/button-react). <br>
The backend is built using NodeJs and Express module.
<br><br>
To start with, navigate to the client ( `cd client` ) and server ( `cd server` ) folders. Start with initialising the NPM by running ` npm init -y `
To run the web app, clone it to your local pc using 
` git clone https://github.com/sid3934/Expenditure-monitor.git `
Once the repository is ready on the local server, navigate to the client folder and run the web app typing `npm start`. <br>
The database is Mongodb and it is hosted for free on the mongodb cloud server. <br>
